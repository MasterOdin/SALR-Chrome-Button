Something Awful Last Read Button Extension for Chrome

This adds a browser action button to the users toolbar, augmenting the functionality
of the SALR extension for Chrome.  If this extension is installed, it will disable
the page action button in the omnibar for SALR.  This extension will not work
without SALR installed.
